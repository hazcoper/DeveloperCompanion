# Developer Companion
Simple to use, wireless and programmable keypad. Make pretty much any key combination and type any amount of text automatically with the click of a button.
Can be customized for whatever size necessary (within the limits of the esp8266 pins)
 

Repository includes python code for the host computer and arduino code for the esp8266
Currently only works on Windows



## Usage

Customize the text files corresponding to each key to type whatever you want when pressed
